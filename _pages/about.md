I am a researcher at the Naval Systems Analysis Center (CASNAV), specializing in the development and deployment of Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs). I hold a degree in Mechatronics Engineering from the University of São Paulo and a degree in Naval Sciences with a specialization in Electronics from the Brazilian Naval Academy.

Currently, I am pursuing a master’s degree in Mechanical Engineering at the University of São Paulo, with a focus on Mechatronics. My research centers on the development of collision avoidance algorithms for USVs.

My work encompasses the research, design, implementation, and operational testing of autonomous maritime systems. I am deeply committed to advancing maritime technology and driven by a passion for innovation in autonomous navigation and control.

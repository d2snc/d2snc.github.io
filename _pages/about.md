I am a researcher at the Naval Systems Analysis Center (CASNAV), specializing in the development and deployment of Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs). I hold a degree in Mechatronics Engineering from the University of São Paulo and a degree in Naval Sciences with a specialization in Electronics from the Brazilian Naval Academy.

Currently, I am pursuing a master’s degree in Mechanical Engineering at the University of São Paulo, with a focus on Mechatronics. My research centers on the development of collision avoidance algorithms for USVs.

My work encompasses the research, design, implementation, and operational testing of autonomous maritime systems. I am deeply committed to advancing maritime technology and driven by a passion for innovation in autonomous navigation and control.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
